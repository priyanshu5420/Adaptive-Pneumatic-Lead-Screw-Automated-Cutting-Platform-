Adaptive Pneumatic–Lead-Screw Automated Cutting Platform is a dual-purpose system that combines soft-robotic and CNC-style precision cutting in a single modular architecture. Initially developed as an assistive device, the platform features a 3D-printed pneumatic silicone gripper, wiper, and cutting arm—driven by an ESP32 microcontroller with joystick interface, I²C display, and real-time sensor feedback—to perform safe, automated slicing tasks. The design was subsequently extended for laboratory applications by integrating a horizontal lead-screw mechanism (6 cm stroke, 3.54 Nm minimum torque) powered by NEMA17 stepper motors (A4988 drivers) and a DC clutch motor, enabling programmable sub-millimeter cuts in wood and metal specimens. All non-load-bearing components were modeled in SolidWorks and fabricated via additive manufacturing, while a steel lead screw ensures structural integrity and precision motion. Safety interlocks, modular fixtures, and an intuitive control scheme make the system both reliable and user-friendly. This repository contains design files, firmware source code, and documentation necessary to reproduce and customize the platform for diverse cutting applications.
